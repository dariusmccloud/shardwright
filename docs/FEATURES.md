## Overview

Shardwright is a SillyTavern extension that compresses roleplay chat history into structured, recoverable "Memory Shards." As conversations grow long, older messages push beyond the LLM's context window and are lost. Shardwright captures that history — summarizing message ranges, managing message visibility, and routing output to system messages or lorebook entries — so nothing important is forgotten.

In **Sharder mode**, summaries are generated as structured documents with 16 labeled sections (timeline, character states, relationships, key dialogue, and more), each tagged with scene codes for precise cross-referencing. An optional **RAG pipeline** vectorizes these shards and automatically injects relevant memories into future generations based on conversation context.

The extension also includes a full **Chat Management** system for browsing, exporting, and summarizing chats across any character — and a **review pipeline** that lets you curate, edit, and weight every section before saving.

---

## Sharder Mode

A unique workflow that creates detailed, structured "Memory Shards" from your roleplay conversations. Toggle this mode to switch from standard summarization to the structured shard generation workflow. Generates and validates in a single API call, producing a structured Memory Shard with 16 labeled sections and scene codes (`[S{StartMsg}:{SceneNum}]`) for cross-referencing across shards.

> **Note:** Sharder Mode and Pre-Edit Events are mutually exclusive—enabling one will disable the other.

**Usage:** Enable **Sharder Mode** in settings, select a message range, and click **"Run Sharder"** (or use the FAB).

---

### The 16 Shard Sections

The AI parses your conversation and identifies key elements organized by tagged sections:

| Section       | Tag               | Description                             |
| ------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Key           | `[KEY]`           | Scene code legend (preamble)            |
| Tone          | `[TONE]`          | Overall mood and atmosphere             |
| Characters    | `[CHARACTERS]`    | Character introductions and notes       |
| World         | `[WORLD]`         | World-building and setting details      |
| Timeline      | `[TIMELINE]`      | Chronological scene progression         |
| Events        | `[EVENTS]`        | Significant plot events                 |
| States        | `[STATES]`        | Character physical/emotional states     |
| Relationships | `[RELATIONSHIPS]` | Relationship dynamics and shifts        |
| Developments  | `[DEVELOPMENTS]`  | Plot and character development          |
| NSFW          | `[NSFW]`          | Adult content (verbatim, conditional)   |
| Dialogue      | `[DIALOGUE]`      | Key dialogue lines                      |
| Voice         | `[VOICE]`         | Character speech patterns and quirks    |
| Anchors       | `[ANCHORS]`       | Memorable moments and callbacks         |
| Callbacks     | `[CALLBACKS]`     | Setups awaiting payoff                  |
| Threads       | `[THREADS]`       | Unresolved plot threads                 |
| Scenes        | `[SCENES]`        | Scene summaries                         |
| Current       | `[CURRENT]`       | Current state snapshot (always present) |

---

### Post-Summary Review

After shard generation, a review modal appears allowing you to:

- ✅ **View** all extracted sections organized by category
- ✏️ **Edit** individual sections before saving
- ☑️ **Select/Deselect** individual items to include or exclude
- ⚖️ **Assign importance weights** (critical / major / moderate / minor / trivial)
- 🗄️ **Archive** sections you want to preserve but not actively inject
- ✂️ **Prune** entries from any section

This gives you fine-grained control over what gets preserved in the final Memory Shard.

---

## Basic Summary Mode

Select a message range and generate a prose summary using your active prompt. Output is saved as a system message or lorebook entry.

**Usage:** Open the extension settings, select a message range (start and end message numbers), and click **"Summarize"** (or use the FAB → Actions → Summarize Now).

---

## Review Pipeline

### Pre-Edit Events

An alternative workflow (mutually exclusive with Sharder Mode) that extracts and lets you review events before generating a summary.

**Workflow:**

1. AI extracts key narrative events from the selected message range
2. Review modal displays extracted events
3. Edit, add, remove, or reorder events as needed
4. Generate summary based on curated events

**Use Case:** When you want more control over what the summary focuses on without the full structured Sharder workflow.

Toggle via **"Pre-Edit Events"** checkbox.

---

### Summary Review

Review and edit summaries before they're saved (available outside of Sharder Mode).

**Review Mode Options:**

| Mode     | Behavior                 |
| -------- | ------------------------ |
| `Always` | Always show review modal |
| `Never`  | Auto-save without review |

**Additional Settings:**

- **Token Threshold** — Trigger review if summary exceeds token count
- **Prompt Change Detection** — Review when prompt has changed since last summary

Toggle via **"Summary Review"** checkbox in the extension panel.

---

## Visibility Controls

Manage the visibility of summarized messages in your chat history.

**Features:**

- **Hide Summarized** — Automatically hide messages after they've been summarized
- **Collapse All** — Collapse summarized message ranges instead of hiding
- **Per-Range Controls** — Independent hide/collapse toggles per message range
- **Per-Range Speaker Ignore Lists** — Exclude specific speakers from visibility changes
- **Global Toggles** — Hide All / Collapse All for bulk control
- **Visibility Modal** — Fine-tune which message ranges are hidden/shown/collapsed
- **Slash Command Sync** — Syncs with SillyTavern's `/hide` and `/unhide` slash commands via MutationObserver

Access via the **"Manage Visibility"** button in the extension panel.

---

## Output Options

### System Messages

Summaries are injected directly into the chat at the summarized position as system messages.

### Lorebook Integration

Save summaries and Memory Shards directly to your World Info/Lorebook for persistent, searchable memory.

**Benefits:**

- 🔍 Vector search compatibility for contextual injection
- 🏷️ Automatic keyword extraction for trigger-based recall
- 📚 Entries persist across chat sessions
- 🔗 Works alongside system message storage

**Setup:** Select your target lorebook from the dropdown and configure entry options.

---

| ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Vectra**  | Default lightweight option     |
| **LanceDB** | Columnar vector database       |
| **Qdrant**  | High-performance vector search |
| **Milvus**  | Distributed vector database    |

### Scoring Methods

| Method            | Description                                        |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |

| **Hybrid Fusion** | Combined scoring via RRF or weighted normalization |

### Section-Aware Chunking

In Sharder mode, chunks are typed for intelligent handling:

| Chunk Type      | Behavior                            |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Superseding** | Newer entries replace older ones    |
| **Cumulative**  | Entries are combined/merged         |
| **Rolling**     | Window-based, older entries age out |

**Additional RAG Features:**

- 🎯 **Scene Expansion** — When a shard hit is retrieved, all chunks from the same scene are pulled in for full context
- 🔀 **Reranker Support** — Optional cross-encoder reranking via Similharity plugin or direct API
- 🗄️ **Warm/Cold Archive** — Warm archive stores shard vectors with hash-based deduplication; cold archive persists entries as JSON in chat metadata with FIFO trimming
- 🧹 **Smart Deduplication** — Prevents redundant injection by checking against recent chat messages
- ⚙️ **Separate RAG Configurations** — Independent settings for Standard mode and Sharder mode
- 🔍 **RAG Debug** — Inspect what was retrieved and why (FAB → Advanced → RAG Debug)
